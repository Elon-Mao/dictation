Catherine here from BBC Learning English.</text><text start="4.52" dur="5.24">Just so you know, this programme
is from the BBC Learning English archive.</text><text start="9.88" dur="4.92">It was originally broadcast
in December 2006 on our website.</text><text start="14.92" dur="1">Enjoy!</text><text start="17.6" dur="2.56">BBC Learning English dot com.</text><text start="20.28" dur="3.4">Hello, I&amp;#39;m Anna Jones
and you&amp;#39;re listening to Weekender</text><text start="23.8" dur="2.76">and this week
we&amp;#39;re talking about handwriting.</text><text start="26.68" dur="3.6">Just how much can you tell
about a person&amp;#39;s personality</text><text start="30.4" dur="2.4">just by looking at how they write?</text><text start="32.92" dur="4.52">And why do some people prefer to write
with a pencil rather than with a pen?</text><text start="37.56" dur="3.88">Well, to answer those questions,
we&amp;#39;re joined in today&amp;#39;s programme</text><text start="41.56" dur="4.92">by handwriting expert Adam Brand
and poet Kate Bingham.</text><text start="46.6" dur="3.2">Have a listen now to Adam
who&amp;#39;s describing the personality</text><text start="49.92" dur="4.64">of someone whose writing &amp;#39;slants&amp;#39;
or &amp;#39;slopes&amp;#39; to the left.</text><text start="54.68" dur="3.36">What are the words he uses
to describe the personality</text><text start="58.16" dur="2.96">of a person whose writing
leans to the left?</text><text start="61.24" dur="3.08">When you have left-slant writing
and close word spacing,</text><text start="64.44" dur="2.16">what you&amp;#39;ve got
is somebody who values their privacy,</text><text start="66.72" dur="2.24">yet has adapted to ease
in social relationships.</text><text start="69.08" dur="2.92">The other thing are the margins
and the left margin&amp;#39;s quite wide,</text><text start="72.12" dur="3.76">so somebody of very high standards,
at the same time slightly reserved again,</text><text start="76" dur="4.32">but the right margin is very straight
and that&amp;#39;s a sign of self-control.</text><text start="80.44" dur="3.08">Well, according to Adam,
if your writing slants to the left</text><text start="83.64" dur="2.24">and if the words are very near
to each other</text><text start="86" dur="3.04">then you are likely
to be &amp;#39;slightly reserved&amp;#39; —</text><text start="89.16" dur="4.28">you don&amp;#39;t show your feeling easily
and may be quiet or shy.</text><text start="93.56" dur="2.76">He says that you may
display &amp;#39;self-control&amp;#39; —</text><text start="96.44" dur="4.6">you are able to control your emotions
and your actions.</text><text start="101.16" dur="3.88">Adam also says that you will have
&amp;#39;very high standards&amp;#39; —</text><text start="105.16" dur="3.76">you&amp;#39;ll set yourself
high moral rules to follow.</text><text start="109.04" dur="2.36">You also &amp;#39;value your privacy&amp;#39; —</text><text start="111.52" dur="4.92">you appreciate your right to keep your
personal matters and relationships secret.</text><text start="117.08" dur="3.92">So Adam is able to tell a lot
about somebody&amp;#39;s personality</text><text start="121.12" dur="2.68">simply by looking at their handwriting.</text><text start="124.52" dur="1.16">Here he is again.</text><text start="125.8" dur="4.8">Listen out for the words he uses
to describe this person&amp;#39;s personality.</text><text start="130.72" dur="2.92">&amp;#39;Slightly reserved&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;self-controlled&amp;#39;,</text><text start="133.76" dur="4.64">&amp;#39;very high standards&amp;#39;
and &amp;#39;value your privacy&amp;#39;.</text><text start="138.52" dur="3.08">When you have left-slant writing
and close word spacing,</text><text start="141.72" dur="2.28">what you&amp;#39;ve got is somebody
who values their privacy</text><text start="144.12" dur="2.2">yet has adapted to ease
to social relationships.</text><text start="146.44" dur="2.96">The other thing are the margins
and the left margin&amp;#39;s quite wide,</text><text start="149.52" dur="3.6">so somebody of very high standards,
at the same time slightly reserved again,</text><text start="153.24" dur="4.4">but the right margin is very straight
and that&amp;#39;s a sign of self-control.</text><text start="157.76" dur="2.04">BBC Learning English.</text><text start="161.04" dur="4.68">Adam goes on to talk about the importance
of children learning how to do &amp;#39;cursive&amp;#39;</text><text start="165.84" dur="2.68">or &amp;#39;joined-up&amp;#39; writing from a young age.</text><text start="168.64" dur="4.16">He says that it is more important that
children learn to do joined-up writing</text><text start="172.92" dur="3.76">than worry about whether
they write with a pen or a pencil.</text><text start="176.8" dur="4.32">Why is this?
Well, Adam says that studies in Canada</text><text start="181.24" dur="5.04">found that children who learn cursive
writing are much more &amp;#39;self-confident&amp;#39; —</text><text start="186.4" dur="3.8">they feel good and confident
about themselves as individuals.</text><text start="190.88" dur="4.64">What&amp;#39;s the other word he uses which has
a similar meaning to &amp;#39;self-confident&amp;#39;?</text><text start="195.64" dur="3.32">When it comes to teaching, I don&amp;#39;t think
it&amp;#39;s the instrument that you use</text><text start="199.08" dur="1.64">as much as how you&amp;#39;re taught.</text><text start="200.84" dur="4.2">It&amp;#39;s very important that children
are taught cursive writing immediately</text><text start="205.16" dur="2.12">and the reason for that
is print writing is about form,</text><text start="207.4" dur="1.72">cursive writing is about movement.</text><text start="209.24" dur="1.52">And they&amp;#39;ve done studies in Canada</text><text start="210.88" dur="3.2">where they&amp;#39;ve found that children
who are taught cursive immediately</text><text start="214.2" dur="3.48">have far better self-esteem,
much more self-confident.</text><text start="217.8" dur="3.56">The word Adam uses which has
a very similar meaning to &amp;#39;self-confident&amp;#39;</text><text start="221.48" dur="3.52">is &amp;#39;self-esteem&amp;#39;. Here&amp;#39;s Adam again.</text><text start="225.12" dur="3.08">When it comes to teaching, I don&amp;#39;t think
it&amp;#39;s the instrument that you use</text><text start="228.32" dur="1.88">as much as how you&amp;#39;re taught.</text><text start="230.32" dur="4.04">It&amp;#39;s very important that children
are taught cursive writing immediately</text><text start="234.48" dur="2.12">and the reason for that
is print writing is about form,</text><text start="236.72" dur="1.68">cursive writing is about movement.</text><text start="238.52" dur="1.68">And they&amp;#39;ve done studies in Canada</text><text start="240.32" dur="3.12">where they&amp;#39;ve found that children
who are taught cursive immediately</text><text start="243.56" dur="3.2">have far better self-esteem,
much more self-confident.</text><text start="246.88" dur="2.92">Kate Bingham is a poet and, unlike Adam,</text><text start="249.92" dur="2.84">she does think
that the choice of instrument</text><text start="252.88" dur="2.4">is important for her when she writes.</text><text start="255.4" dur="1.8">What does she use to write with?</text><text start="257.32" dur="1.36">I use a pencil.</text><text start="258.8" dur="2.52">When you&amp;#39;re drafting,
it&amp;#39;s a little bit like sketching</text><text start="261.44" dur="2.44">and I put words all over the page.</text><text start="264" dur="4">It&amp;#39;s a bit like a pictogram almost
and a pencil is perfect for me.</text><text start="268.12" dur="1.76">Kate uses a pencil.</text><text start="270" dur="1.96">She says that when she is &amp;#39;drafting&amp;#39; —</text><text start="272.08" dur="3.24">when she puts ideas and thoughts
down onto paper,</text><text start="275.44" dur="2.52">she says it&amp;#39;s like sketching or drawing.</text><text start="278.08" dur="4.04">She puts words all over the page
and it becomes almost like a picture</text><text start="282.24" dur="4.64">and a pencil is the perfect instrument
for her to draft her ideas.</text><text start="287" dur="4.68">She says she prefers working with a pencil
and paper than writing on computer.</text><text start="291.8" dur="1.48">Why does she say that?</text><text start="293.4" dur="2.48">If you&amp;#39;re writing to a screen,
then you have to sit up</text><text start="296" dur="3.92">and your line of sight is different
and if you&amp;#39;re with a piece of paper,</text><text start="300.04" dur="1.44">you tend to bend over</text><text start="301.6" dur="3.04">and I think there&amp;#39;s a different kind of,
a different quality of concentration.</text><text start="304.76" dur="2.88">Well, Kate says that
if she writes at a computer screen</text><text start="307.76" dur="2.36">then her &amp;#39;line of sight&amp;#39; is different —</text><text start="310.24" dur="3.76">her view of the words
is not the same on the screen</text><text start="314.12" dur="2.88">as when she writes on a piece of paper.</text><text start="317.12" dur="2.88">She also says
that her concentration is better.</text><text start="320.12" dur="2.36">She has to bend over the paper to work</text><text start="322.6" dur="3.92">and this make her concentrate
more intently on what she&amp;#39;s writing.</text><text start="327.48" dur="2.88">Well, that&amp;#39;s about
all we have time for today.</text><text start="330.48" dur="4.68">Have a look at your own handwriting
and see what it reveals about you!</text><text start="335.28" dur="2.88">BBC Learning English dot com.</text></transcript>
