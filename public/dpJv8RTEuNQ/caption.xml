change the way Alzheimer&amp;#39;s</text><text start="26.52" dur="4.68">is treated. The medication
slows down memory loss</text><text start="31.2" dur="1.52">and confusion,</text><text start="32.72" dur="3.48">according to recent
scientific trials.</text><text start="36.2" dur="4.36">This means people with the disease could
still do everyday tasks</text><text start="40.56" dur="3.8">like shopping, cooking and cleaning.</text><text start="44.36" dur="5.04">Scientists hope that Alzheimer&amp;#39;s will
be managed as easily as asthma</text><text start="49.4" dur="1.88">and diabetes.</text><text start="51.28" dur="1.76">You&amp;#39;ve been looking
at the headlines, Beth.</text><text start="53.04" dur="1.84">What&amp;#39;s the vocabulary?</text><text start="54.88" dur="4.32">We have turning point,
beginning of the end</text><text start="59.2" dur="3.24">and to remember.
This is News Review from</text><text start="62.44" dur="2.48">BBC Learning English.</text><text start="72.8" dur="2.88">Let&amp;#39;s have a look at
our first headline.</text><text start="75.68" dur="2.4">This is from
The Guardian.</text><text start="78.08" dur="4.28">Experts urge health regulators to
approve &amp;#39;turning point&amp;#39;</text><text start="82.36" dur="1.48">dementia drugs.</text><text start="83.84" dur="4.88">So, this headline describes these drugs
as a turning point. &amp;#39;turning point&amp;#39;</text><text start="88.72" dur="4.8">is the expression that we&amp;#39;re looking
at and if you literally turn,</text><text start="93.52" dur="1.92">it&amp;#39;s because you have
made a decision.</text><text start="95.44" dur="3.04">So, for example,
you&amp;#39;re walking down the road.</text><text start="98.48" dur="3.36">You decide that you need to go into
a shop to buy something,</text><text start="101.84" dur="1.8">you turn, literally.</text><text start="103.64" dur="4.92">Yes. That&amp;#39;s literal and it helps with
understanding the metaphorical meaning</text><text start="108.56" dur="5.72">because &amp;#39;turning point&amp;#39;
or &amp;#39;a turning point&amp;#39; is a big change.</text><text start="114.28" dur="2.52">It&amp;#39;s going from one
idea to another</text><text start="116.8" dur="2.8">or maybe something positive
to something negative,</text><text start="119.6" dur="2.24">or something negative
to something positive.</text><text start="121.84" dur="5.04">Yes. So this headline is describing
these drugs as a turning point.</text><text start="126.88" dur="4.32">It could mean a really big change
for people with Alzheimer&amp;#39;s.</text><text start="131.2" dur="0.76">Yes, that&amp;#39;s right.</text><text start="131.96" dur="4">And this expression is very
often used when we&amp;#39;re talking</text><text start="135.96" dur="2.48">about a change for the positive,</text><text start="138.44" dur="1.8">just like in this headline.</text><text start="140.24" dur="2.4">Another example, could
be when you have children –</text><text start="142.64" dur="2.36">it&amp;#39;s a turning point
in your life.</text><text start="145" dur="2.2">Yes, that&amp;#39;s a big
change for people.</text><text start="147.2" dur="1.64">Also, if you get a new job,</text><text start="148.84" dur="2.64">we could call that
a turning point.</text><text start="151.48" dur="2">Let&amp;#39;s look at that again.</text><text start="161.08" dur="2.28">Let&amp;#39;s look at our
next headline.</text><text start="163.36" dur="3">This is from Sky News.</text><text start="166.36" dur="5.8">New Alzheimer&amp;#39;s drugs could spell
&amp;#39;beginning of the end&amp;#39; for disease.</text><text start="172.16" dur="3.12">Yes. So these drugs could be</text><text start="175.28" dur="3.28">the &amp;#39;beginning
of the end&amp;#39;.</text><text start="178.56" dur="4.72">That means the start of events
that lead to something finishing.</text><text start="183.28" dur="2.68">It sounds a little bit confusing.
Can you explain more, Beth?</text><text start="185.96" dur="3.88">Yes. So &amp;#39;the beginning
of the end&amp;#39; is used in the headline</text><text start="189.84" dur="5.56">because these drugs are now being tested
and they might become available soon.</text><text start="195.4" dur="5.44">So, that means we&amp;#39;re at the start of
the disease becoming easier to manage</text><text start="200.84" dur="4.56">which could then, kind of, be the end
for Alzheimer&amp;#39;s as we know it today.</text><text start="205.4" dur="4">Yeah. So this expression
is usually used for quite big things</text><text start="209.4" dur="1.36">like a cure for a disease.</text><text start="210.76" dur="4.8">So, for example, when the
Covid vaccines became available,</text><text start="215.56" dur="3.92">it was the beginning of the
end of the pandemic.</text><text start="219.48" dur="0.48">That&amp;#39;s right.</text><text start="219.96" dur="4.36">And it&amp;#39;s much more common nowadays
to type on a phone or a computer.</text><text start="224.32" dur="3.6">So, what do you think, Neil? Could
it be the beginning of the end</text><text start="227.92" dur="1.76">for the pen and pencil?
It could be, yes.</text><text start="229.68" dur="2.32">Let&amp;#39;s look at that again.</text><text start="238" dur="1.96">Let&amp;#39;s have our next
headline.</text><text start="239.96" dur="3">This is from The Times.</text><text start="242.96" dur="5.68">The Times view on Alzheimer&amp;#39;s drug
treatment: Breakthrough to Remember.</text><text start="248.64" dur="2.88">So, this headline calls these drugs</text><text start="251.52" dur="4.92">a &amp;#39;breakthrough to remember&amp;#39;.
&amp;#39;A breakthrough&amp;#39; is an</text><text start="256.44" dur="1.48">important discovery
or development.</text><text start="257.92" dur="3.16">We&amp;#39;re looking at &amp;#39;to remember&amp;#39;.</text><text start="261.08" dur="1.76">Now, &amp;#39;remember&amp;#39;,
we all know that.
 </text><text start="262.84" dur="2.84">We do. But this is
&amp;#39;to remember&amp;#39;.</text><text start="265.68" dur="4.84">So, we use after a noun and we mean
that something is so important</text><text start="270.52" dur="4.4">that it will be remembered by a lot
of people, maybe even far into the future.</text><text start="274.92" dur="3.72">Yes. So the headline
is saying that this breakthrough,</text><text start="278.64" dur="3.56">these drugs, are very important
to the world of science.</text><text start="282.2" dur="4.92">It&amp;#39;s a memorable event and
they use &amp;#39;to remember&amp;#39; to mean that.</text><text start="287.12" dur="3.44">Exactly. We can also use this
with personal situations.</text><text start="290.56" dur="4.92">Maybe you have a birthday party with
all your family and friends and you say</text><text start="295.48" dur="3.48">Wow, it was a
night to remember.</text><text start="298.96" dur="2.4">You&amp;#39;re not going to forget it
because it was so great.</text><text start="301.36" dur="3.68">Or maybe your wedding day
was a day to remember.</text><text start="305.04" dur="2.64">Yeah. Now, it&amp;#39;s important
to point out that</text><text start="307.68" dur="1.24">this is a clever headline.</text><text start="308.92" dur="4.08">It has got a double meaning,
as we often see in headlines.</text><text start="313" dur="4.24">It uses &amp;#39;to remember&amp;#39;,
this expression. And of course</text><text start="317.24" dur="5.12">one of the main symptoms of Alzheimer&amp;#39;s
is not being able to remember things.</text><text start="322.36" dur="2.64">Let&amp;#39;s look at that again.</text><text start="330.12" dur="3.24">We&amp;#39;ve had: turning point –
a big change,</text><text start="333.36" dur="1.88">usually for the better.
 </text><text start="335.24" dur="4.36">beginning of the end – the
start of something bad stopping.</text><text start="339.6" dur="3.16"> 
And &amp;#39;to remember&amp;#39; – 
unforgettable.</text><text start="342.76" dur="3.24">Now, if you have enjoyed this episode, we recently spoke about</text><text start="345.759" dur="6.241">how having a nap can reduce the risk of developing diseases like Alzheimer&amp;#39;s.  </text><text start="352.32" dur="1.72">Click here to watch that episode .</text><text start="354.04" dur="5.48">Don&amp;#39;t forget to click here to subscribe to our channel so you never miss another video.</text><text start="359.52" dur="8.12">Thanks for joining us.
