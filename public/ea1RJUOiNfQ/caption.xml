do if you&amp;#39;ve found someone collapsed.</text><text start="12.58" dur="2.82">The initial assessment is called a primary
survey.</text><text start="15.48" dur="6.44">This is a quick, orderly assessment to
establish how best to treat our casualty in order of priority.</text><text start="22.12" dur="7.56">We can use the initials DR. ABC or DRABC to remind us of the steps we need to follow.</text><text start="29.86" dur="7.02">These initials stand for Danger, Response, Airway, Breathing and Circulation.</text><text start="38.4" dur="6.62">So, when I see a casualty, first I’m going to check for any danger, to make sure it’s safe for me to approach them.</text><text start="45.02" dur="2.26">I don’t want to become a casualty myself.</text><text start="50.14" dur="3.32">Then I’m going to see if I can get any response from the casualty.</text><text start="53.46" dur="6.58">As you approach, introduce yourself. Ask them questions to try to get a response.</text><text start="60.72" dur="3.52">If they are not alert and do not respond to your voice,</text><text start="64.24" dur="3.7">kneel down beside them and gently shake their shoulders</text><text start="67.95" dur="4.52">&amp;#39;Hello Amy, it&amp;#39;s Winston, can you hear me?
Open your eyes.&amp;#39;</text><text start="72.78" dur="4.8">Still no response? You can pinch their ear lobe to see if they respond to pain.</text><text start="77.58" dur="4.92">Depending on how the casualty responds to you will stablish a level of response.</text><text start="82.5" dur="5.58">We use the AVPU scale and each letter can represent the casualty’s level of response.</text><text start="89.06" dur="10.2">A – Alert, V- response to voice, P – response to pain and U – is the casualty unresponsive to any stimuli.</text><text start="99.82" dur="5.32">If there’s still no response they are unresponsive and we need to check their airway.</text><text start="105.16" dur="5.98">If the casualty is alert and speaking to you, you know that there is no problem with the airway. It is clear.</text><text start="111.14" dur="5.94">If the casualty is unresponsive, open their airway by putting one hand on the forehead</text><text start="117.18" dur="4.26">and gently tilting the head back with two fingers under the chin.</text><text start="121.44" dur="3.04">Now we need to check to see if they are breathing normally.</text><text start="124.48" dur="4">We do this by placing our ear and cheek over their nose and mouth,</text><text start="128.48" dur="3.92">looking down the body to see if their chest rises and falls.</text><text start="132.62" dur="2.84">We do this for 10 seconds.</text><text start="143.56" dur="3.7">If the casualty is not breathing normally call for help.</text><text start="147.26" dur="6.5">Ask them to call 999/112 for emergency help and bring an AED.</text><text start="153.76" dur="5.4">If you are alone, call for emergency help using a mobile on speaker phone</text><text start="159.16" dur="3.42">and begin CPR with chest compressions.</text><text start="162.58" dur="4.36">The casualty is breathing normally, so I’m going to check their circulation.</text><text start="166.94" dur="4.14">Are there any signs of severe bleeding? Look and check down the body.</text><text start="178.7" dur="5.42">If you find severe bleeding, try to control the bleeding to prevent life-threatening shock.</text><text start="184.12" dur="6.2">Call 999/112 for emergency help before continuing to treat the casualty.</text><text start="190.72" dur="2.3">You may also need to treat them for shock.</text><text start="193.66" dur="2.36">I’ve established that my casualty is not bleeding.</text><text start="197.36" dur="5.52">So remember  to do a primary survey:
Follow the order DR ABC.</text><text start="202.98" dur="4.08">Complete each step, in that order, as quickly as possible,</text><text start="207.08" dur="3.66">dealing with any life-threatening conditions as you find them.</text><text start="211.48" dur="4.32">Call for emergency help – call 999/112.</text><text start="215.96" dur="3.24">And that’s how we perform a primary survey.</text><text start="220.18" dur="4.89">If this video has been helpful to you,
