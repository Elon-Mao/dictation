Well, I&amp;#39;m gonna focus on this in this video. We&amp;#39;re  </text><text start="6.66" dur="4.92">going to talk about the British English Modern 
Received Pronunciation of these two words. We&amp;#39;ll  </text><text start="11.58" dur="4.44">practice them in sentences together and by the 
end of this video you will know how to pronounce  </text><text start="16.02" dur="5.28">these two and you&amp;#39;ll never confuse them again 
or confuse other people. Hi! My name is Emma and  </text><text start="21.3" dur="4.74">welcome to my channel Pronunciation with Emma,

sounds, comparing them with each other,  </text><text start="57.54" dur="5.94">and it will lead you all the way up to the most 
advanced features of pronunciation. By learning  </text><text start="63.48" dur="5.28">more about these Advanced features you&amp;#39;ll be 
able to understand native speakers much more  </text><text start="68.76" dur="5.88">easily as well as sound more fluent and natural 
with your own speech. So if all of that sounds  </text><text start="74.64" dur="4.5">like your cuppa tea and something you&amp;#39;d be 
interested, in the link to Pronunciation Pro  </text><text start="79.14" dur="6">is down below in the description. Go and check 
it out! Let&amp;#39;s start with one word at a time:  </text><text start="86.22" dur="8.34">work work. Notice that the &amp;#39;r&amp;#39; is silent in 
British English Modern Received pronunciation.  </text><text start="95.34" dur="8.58">Work. We have that first sound /w/ so make sure 
that your top teeth are not touching your bottom  </text><text start="103.92" dur="10.32">lip. So not /v/ &amp;#39;vork&amp;#39; but &amp;#39;work&amp;#39; so make sure 
your lips are very small, very round, /w/, and  </text><text start="114.24" dur="6.06">then they get bigger to move on to the vowel 
sound. So that vowel sound is super relaxed,  </text><text start="120.3" dur="7.98">&amp;#39;uh&amp;#39;, notice I&amp;#39;m not doing anything, it&amp;#39;s super 
lazy, nothing is being tensed, nothing is moving,  </text><text start="128.28" dur="7.08">the tongue is not high, it&amp;#39;s all relaxed, it&amp;#39;s all 
relaxed, all flat, not doing anything. In theory,  </text><text start="135.36" dur="5.16">this should be the easiest sound ever to pronounce 
because it&amp;#39;s so lazy, you don&amp;#39;t have to do  </text><text start="140.52" dur="7.2">anything. But it&amp;#39;s not because we&amp;#39;re so used to 
having to do something with our mouths, that it&amp;#39;s  </text><text start="147.72" dur="6.72">a strange concept to make a sound without doing 
anything, right? But trust me, don&amp;#39;t do anything.  </text><text start="155.16" dur="6.42">&amp;#39;uh&amp;#39;. Now let&amp;#39;s put that together 
with the /w/, we get &amp;#39;wor&amp;#39;. Now,  </text><text start="161.58" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t try and pronounce that &amp;#39;r&amp;#39;. There are 
some accents where they do pronounce it,  </text><text start="165.72" dur="5.58">but in Modern Received Pronunciation, and even 
Received Pronunciation, and the majority of  </text><text start="171.3" dur="6.72">accents across the UK, they don&amp;#39;t pronounce 
the &amp;#39;r&amp;#39;. So together, so far we&amp;#39;ve got &amp;#39;wor&amp;#39;,  </text><text start="178.56" dur="5.94">super relaxed, make sure you&amp;#39;re not saying 
&amp;#39;where&amp;#39;, make sure you&amp;#39;re not smiling, make sure  </text><text start="184.5" dur="7.56">not raising the tongue &amp;#39;wor&amp;#39; super lazy. Then, we 
just add that /k/ to the end. So it&amp;#39;s pronounced  </text><text start="192.06" dur="5.64">at the back here, /k/. Make sure you&amp;#39;re not 
doing something like a /x/ sound, so not &amp;#39;work&amp;#39;  </text><text start="198.24" dur="9.3">but &amp;#39;work&amp;#39; &amp;#39;work&amp;#39;. Now, for the second word, 
the key difference here is the vowel sound,  </text><text start="207.54" dur="6.96">they&amp;#39;re both different vowel sounds. Everything 
else around them is exactly the same. So that &amp;#39;l&amp;#39;  </text><text start="214.5" dur="8.46">is completely silent. We don&amp;#39;t say remove it. It&amp;#39;s 
hard to pronounce actually. So remove that &amp;#39;l&amp;#39;,  </text><text start="222.96" dur="9.6">it is silent. &amp;#39;wa&amp;#39; notice the mouth placement, 
this time is much rounder, &amp;#39;wa&amp;#39;. Jaw drops  </text><text start="232.56" dur="12.18">a little bit &amp;#39;wa&amp;#39; &amp;#39;walk&amp;#39; &amp;#39;walk&amp;#39;. So let&amp;#39;s 
break it down again, sound by sound. /w/ &amp;#39;wa&amp;#39;  </text><text start="244.74" dur="6.72">so that &amp;#39;o&amp;#39; make sure it&amp;#39;s nice and long. 
Don&amp;#39;t make it short otherwise it becomes  </text><text start="251.46" dur="5.34">&amp;#39;wok&amp;#39; and that&amp;#39;s a different word. Take 
that &amp;#39;wok&amp;#39; but make the vowel longer,  </text><text start="256.8" dur="8.52">&amp;#39;walk&amp;#39;, drop that jaw, make it round, &amp;#39;walk&amp;#39;. 
Let&amp;#39;s compare it to the other one: &amp;#39;work&amp;#39;,  </text><text start="265.32" dur="9.96">super lazy. &amp;#39;walk&amp;#39;, jaw drops and it&amp;#39;s rounder. 
Then the last sound, exactly the same /k/ &amp;#39;alk&amp;#39;,  </text><text start="277.08" dur="8.46">&amp;#39;walk&amp;#39;&amp;#39; walk&amp;#39;. Let&amp;#39;s practice now 
in some sentences. &amp;#39;I walk to work&amp;#39;.  </text><text start="287.94" dur="6.54">I &amp;#39;wa&amp;#39;, make sure it&amp;#39;s 
rounded, walk, make it long,  </text><text start="295.08" dur="12.96">I walk to work. Relax it. Super lazy 
and a long sound. work. I walk to work.  </text><text start="309.54" dur="11.94">I work, uh, I work in a shop. I work 
in a shop. They walk to the station.  </text><text start="322.86" dur="9.24">They &amp;#39;wa&amp;#39;, nice and round, not &amp;#39;wok&amp;#39;. Walk. 
Make it longer. They walk to the station,  </text><text start="332.88" dur="6.3">they walk to the station. Well done for 
sticking to the end of this lesson. I know  </text><text start="339.18" dur="4.8">it was a lengthy one, but I really really wanted 
to create a lesson that talked about these two  </text><text start="343.98" dur="6.48">words in detail because I know they can be a 
real pain in the bum. I hope you enjoyed it.  </text><text start="350.46" dur="4.56">Check out my pronunciation course if you&amp;#39;re
