from BBC Learning English.</text><text start="3.6" dur="5.24">Just so you know, this programme
is from the BBC Learning English archive.</text><text start="8.96" dur="5.4">It was originally broadcast
in November 2006 on our website.</text><text start="14.48" dur="1.64">We hope you enjoy it!</text><text start="17.76" dur="4.24">BBC Learning English dot com.</text><text start="22.12" dur="3.52">Hello, I&amp;#39;m Callum Robertson
and this is London Life.</text><text start="25.76" dur="4.28">In the programme today,
we take a brief look at rhyming slang,</text><text start="30.16" dur="2.24">an interesting form of vocabulary</text><text start="32.52" dur="4.16">where an expression which rhymes
with the word you mean is used.</text><text start="36.8" dur="3.44">For example, the phrase &amp;#39;boat race&amp;#39;.</text><text start="40.36" dur="3.96">The &amp;#39;boat race&amp;#39; is a famous sporting event
held in London,</text><text start="44.44" dur="5.24">but the phrase &amp;#39;boat race&amp;#39;
is also rhyming slang for &amp;#39;face&amp;#39;.</text><text start="49.8" dur="2.36">&amp;#39;Race&amp;#39; rhymes with &amp;#39;face&amp;#39;.</text><text start="53.16" dur="1.6">One of the features of rhyming slang</text><text start="54.88" dur="3.8">is that, often,
the word that rhymes is not actually said.</text><text start="58.8" dur="4.68">So, for example, &amp;#39;boat race&amp;#39;
is shortened to just &amp;#39;boat&amp;#39;.</text><text start="63.6" dur="3.84">&amp;#39;She&amp;#39;s got a pretty boat&amp;#39;
means &amp;#39;she&amp;#39;s got a pretty face&amp;#39;.</text><text start="68.36" dur="3.56">It&amp;#39;s not unusual to hear rhyming slang
expressions all over the country,</text><text start="72.04" dur="3.08">but perhaps it&amp;#39;s best known
as &amp;#39;cockney rhyming slang&amp;#39;.</text><text start="76.12" dur="4.48">A cockney is someone who comes from
a particular part of east London,</text><text start="80.72" dur="4.32">but what is rhyming slang
and how did it come about?</text><text start="85.16" dur="3.16">Here&amp;#39;s a true cockney, Larry Barnes,
to explain.</text><text start="88.44" dur="3.56">What does he say
the word &amp;#39;slang&amp;#39; stands for</text><text start="92.12" dur="3.08">and where does he say &amp;#39;rhyming slang&amp;#39;
comes from?</text><text start="95.32" dur="5.16">Rhyming slang was originally,
well, &amp;#39;s-lang&amp;#39;,</text><text start="100.6" dur="2.12">&amp;#39;secret language&amp;#39;,</text><text start="102.84" dur="2.68">whereas I was always taught,
as a youngster,</text><text start="105.64" dur="4.76">it was the secret language of the markets,
so that if a stallholder</text><text start="110.52" dur="3.24">wanted to talk to a stallholder
on the opposite side of the street,</text><text start="113.88" dur="3.28">without the punters in the middle
knowing what he was talking about,</text><text start="117.28" dur="1.72">he&amp;#39;d use rhyming slang.</text><text start="119.12" dur="4.88">He says that &amp;#39;slang&amp;#39; stands for &amp;#39;s-lang&amp;#39;,</text><text start="124.12" dur="2.92">a short form of &amp;#39;secret language&amp;#39;,</text><text start="127.16" dur="4.08">and that rhyming slang
came from the markets.</text><text start="131.36" dur="3">The people who work on a market
are the stallholders,</text><text start="134.48" dur="4.6">and if they wanted to talk to each other
without the customers understanding,</text><text start="139.2" dur="1.8">they would use rhyming slang.</text><text start="141.12" dur="2.6">Now, notice he doesn&amp;#39;t say
the word &amp;#39;customers&amp;#39;,</text><text start="143.84" dur="1.76">he says the word &amp;#39;punters&amp;#39;,</text><text start="145.72" dur="5.6">which is another common slang expression
for a customer, a &amp;#39;punter&amp;#39;. Listen again.</text><text start="151.44" dur="5.04">Rhyming slang was originally,
well, &amp;#39;s-lang&amp;#39;,</text><text start="156.6" dur="2.16">&amp;#39;secret language&amp;#39;,</text><text start="158.88" dur="2.76">whereas I was always taught,
as a youngster,</text><text start="161.76" dur="4.72">it was the secret language of the markets,
so that if a stallholder</text><text start="166.6" dur="3.2">wanted to talk to a stallholder
on the opposite side of the street,</text><text start="169.92" dur="3.36">without the punters in the middle knowing
what he was talking about,</text><text start="173.4" dur="1.6">he&amp;#39;d use rhyming slang.</text><text start="175.12" dur="5">He goes on to give an example of a
sentence using traditional rhyming slang.</text><text start="180.24" dur="2.84">First, he gives the sentence
in regular English</text><text start="183.2" dur="3.56">and then he gives the sentence
in rhyming slang.</text><text start="186.88" dur="2.28">Have a listen.
See if you can catch any of it.</text><text start="189.28" dur="1.08">He wouldn&amp;#39;t say,</text><text start="190.48" dur="3.16">&amp;quot;Do you fancy a walk down the road
to the pub for a quick pint of beer?&amp;quot;</text><text start="193.76" dur="1.96">He&amp;#39;d say,
&amp;quot;Do you fancy a ball down the frog</text><text start="195.84" dur="1.84">&amp;quot;to the rubber for
a quick pint of wallop?&amp;quot;</text><text start="197.8" dur="3.2">Hm, I think maybe that needs
a little translation.</text><text start="201.12" dur="3">First, let&amp;#39;s hear
the normal English sentence again.</text><text start="204.24" dur="3.48">&amp;quot;Do you fancy a walk down the road
to the pub for a quick pint of beer?&amp;quot;</text><text start="207.84" dur="6.2">&amp;quot;Do you fancy a walk down the road
to the pub for a quick pint of beer?&amp;quot;</text><text start="214.16" dur="3.44">Now, what about the rhyming slang version?</text><text start="217.72" dur="3.32">&amp;quot;Do you fancy a ball down the frog
to the rubber for a quick pint of wallop?&amp;quot;</text><text start="221.16" dur="5.72">&amp;quot;Do you fancy a ball down the frog
to the rubber for a quick pint of wallop?&amp;quot;</text><text start="227" dur="2">Well, let&amp;#39;s translate that now.</text><text start="229.12" dur="1.88">&amp;#39;Do you fancy&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Would you like&amp;#39;,</text><text start="231.12" dur="6">&amp;#39;a ball&amp;#39; — &amp;#39;ball&amp;#39; is the shortened form
of the expression &amp;#39;ball of chalk&amp;#39;,</text><text start="237.24" dur="3.32">which is cockney rhyming slang for &amp;#39;walk&amp;#39;.</text><text start="240.68" dur="2.64">Next, we go &amp;#39;down the frog&amp;#39;.</text><text start="243.44" dur="3.56">&amp;#39;Frog&amp;#39; is the shortened form
of &amp;#39;frog and toad&amp;#39;,</text><text start="247.12" dur="3.28">which is rhyming slang for &amp;#39;road&amp;#39;.</text><text start="250.52" dur="2.8">Then we have &amp;#39;a quick pint of wallop&amp;#39;.</text><text start="253.44" dur="4.64">&amp;#39;Wallop&amp;#39; isn&amp;#39;t rhyming slang,
but it is an old slang word for &amp;#39;beer&amp;#39;.</text><text start="258.2" dur="2.12">So putting that all together, we have,</text><text start="260.44" dur="2.76">&amp;#39;Do you fancy a ball down the frog
for a quick pint of wallop?&amp;#39;</text><text start="263.32" dur="2.48">BBC Learning English dot com</text><text start="265.92" dur="4.64">A feature of rhyming slang
is that it changes and develops.</text><text start="270.68" dur="3.32">A new book has just been published
which updates rhyming slang.</text><text start="274.12" dur="2.52">It&amp;#39;s called Shame About The Boat Race,</text><text start="276.76" dur="3.72">and Duncan Black works for its publisher,
Collins.</text><text start="280.6" dur="3.6">He explains how celebrities
and characters from television</text><text start="284.32" dur="4.48">have become part of rhyming slang
and he mentions a number of celebrities.</text><text start="288.92" dur="2.44">Britney Spears is one of them.</text><text start="291.48" dur="2.96">What&amp;#39;s her name rhyming slang for?</text><text start="294.56" dur="4.8">Well, generally, new slang terms tend to
focus around pop culture and celebrities.</text><text start="299.48" dur="3.12">My personal favourite are &amp;#39;Britneys&amp;#39;
for &amp;#39;Britney Spears, beers&amp;#39;,</text><text start="302.72" dur="2.56">&amp;#39;Basil&amp;#39; as in &amp;#39;Basil Fawlty, balti&amp;#39;</text><text start="305.4" dur="1.88">or &amp;#39;Billie Piper&amp;#39;
as in &amp;#39;windscreen wiper&amp;#39;.</text><text start="307.4" dur="2.6">&amp;#39;Britney Spears, beers&amp;#39;,</text><text start="310.12" dur="4.24">so now you can say you go down to the pub
&amp;#39;for a few Britneys&amp;#39;.</text><text start="314.48" dur="3">He also mentions some names
from British television —</text><text start="317.6" dur="4.64">&amp;#39;Basil Fawlty&amp;#39;, rhyming slang
for the Indian food &amp;#39;balti&amp;#39;</text><text start="322.36" dur="4.08">and &amp;#39;Billie Piper&amp;#39;,
slang for &amp;#39;windscreen wiper&amp;#39;,</text><text start="326.56" dur="1.88">part of your car.</text><text start="328.56" dur="5.44">Making new rhyming slang
is very easy and egalitarian.</text><text start="334.12" dur="2.64">&amp;#39;Egalitarian&amp;#39; means: anyone can do it,</text><text start="336.88" dur="4.16">it&amp;#39;s not something that only
specialists and experts can do.</text><text start="341.16" dur="1.92">Duncan Black explains how.</text><text start="343.2" dur="2.76">And it&amp;#39;s very easy to use,
it&amp;#39;s egalitarian. Anyone can have a go.</text><text start="346.08" dur="3.76">You just need a name or something
or someone which rhymes with something.</text><text start="349.96" dur="3.24">&amp;quot;Anyone can have a go,&amp;quot; he says.
Anyone can try it.</text><text start="353.32" dur="3.08">You just need a name
which rhymes with something.</text><text start="356.52" dur="1.92">So why not have a go yourself?</text><text start="358.56" dur="3.8">Try and make a sentence in which
you replace the name of an object</text><text start="362.48" dur="3">with the name of a celebrity which rhymes.</text><text start="365.6" dur="4.24">Well, that&amp;#39;s all for today. I&amp;#39;m off to the
Indian for a &amp;#39;Basil&amp;#39; and some &amp;#39;Britneys&amp;#39;.</text><text start="369.96" dur="3.24">BBC Learning English dot com.</text></transcript>
