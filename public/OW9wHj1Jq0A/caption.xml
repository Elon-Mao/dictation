<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="4.58" dur="4.153">Ah, welcome back to the Dota Archives.</text><text start="9" dur="2.97">Since your last visit,
I&amp;#39;ve been extremely busy,</text><text start="11.97" dur="3.63">digging yet deeper into the
background of our beloved game,</text><text start="15.6" dur="2.67">and I&amp;#39;ve stumbled upon a
category, which previously,</text><text start="18.27" dur="2.527">nobody had thought to make content about,</text><text start="20.797" dur="1.793">Dota 2 heroes.</text><text start="22.59" dur="1.29">Heroes they may be,</text><text start="23.88" dur="3.33">but sometimes even the
best of us can fall short.</text><text start="27.21" dur="1.89">Let us burrow into the archives</text><text start="29.1" dur="2.25">and find out which have failed,</text><text start="31.35" dur="1.113">and which succeeded.</text><text start="33.69" dur="1.05">To get us started,</text><text start="34.74" dur="2.82">let&amp;#39;s first review the
latecomers to our game.</text><text start="37.56" dur="2.34">No failures here, of course.</text><text start="39.9" dur="2.43">New heroes are universally beloved</text><text start="42.33" dur="2.433">and certainly above reproach.</text><text start="46.458" dur="2.358">Every new hero that comes
just ruins the game.</text><text start="48.81" dur="3.2">I think there are way too many heroes
that are super strong on release.</text><text start="52.11" dur="5.236">Absolutely every hero in their
initial state is simply insane.</text><text start="57.478" dur="1.832">Honestly, a lot of the
new heroes are really...</text><text start="59.31" dur="1.77">no, it&amp;#39;s Primal Beast.</text><text start="61.08" dur="2.85">Primal Beast was the most broken hero.</text><text start="63.93" dur="3.496">Primal Beast wrecking everyone,
that was just brutal.</text><text start="67.62" dur="1.62">Primal Beast, you just see... BULUBULUBULU</text><text start="69.24" dur="1.104">coming around the corner, you know?</text><text start="70.73" dur="1.83">Every single game you play
versus a good Primal Beast,</text><text start="72.563" dur="2.11">he&amp;#39;s 20 and 0 at like minute 15.</text><text start="75.66" dur="3.324">Primal Beast is unbalanced
because when it first came out,</text><text start="79.102" dur="2.588">its damage is way too high,</text><text start="81.69" dur="3.635">and its attributes, starting strength
and health, are all overpowered.</text><text start="85.58" dur="5.254">The hero gets picked
every game if it&amp;#39;s not banned.</text><text start="91.11" dur="2.37">Soon as I saw Primal,
I don&amp;#39;t even know what to pic/k.</text><text start="93.48" dur="0.99">I can&amp;#39;t hit him in lane.</text><text start="94.47" dur="0.93">I can&amp;#39;t out CS him.</text><text start="95.4" dur="1.98">He has 20 more damage from
level one for some reason,</text><text start="97.38" dur="1.44">and he kills me from full HP.</text><text start="98.82" dur="2.46">Primal Beast and Marci,</text><text start="101.28" dur="2.1">both those heroes were
like abominable on release.</text><text start="103.38" dur="1.71">You literally, like, when
they&amp;#39;re on your screen,</text><text start="105.09" dur="2.88">you&amp;#39;re dead already, like
it&amp;#39;s too late if you see them.</text><text start="107.97" dur="1.85">You have to not see them to be alive.</text><text start="111.67" dur="1.67">Interesting defensive stratagem,</text><text start="113.34" dur="2.1">merely avoid noticing the enemy.</text><text start="115.44" dur="2.76">I&amp;#39;ve certainly had a lot of
luck staying alive in Dota</text><text start="118.2" dur="2.61">by simply not having any
idea what&amp;#39;s happening.</text><text start="120.81" dur="2.04">And I&amp;#39;m sure our young professional there</text><text start="122.85" dur="2.85">understands that better than most.</text><text start="125.7" dur="3.45">Perhaps my good friend,
Sun Wukong, Monkey King,</text><text start="129.15" dur="3.15">introduced way back in 2016</text><text start="132.3" dur="2.893">will be better received
by our professionals, mm?</text><text start="137.51" dur="3.307">There was the chimp
with 500 damage on level one.</text><text start="140.949" dur="1.701">Like only Doom had 150 range</text><text start="142.65" dur="1.29">compared to melee heroes 128,</text><text start="143.94" dur="1.635">but Monkey King had like 800,</text><text start="145.71" dur="1.538">so he just smacked you across the map.</text><text start="147.363" dur="1.227">His Jingus would never run out.</text><text start="148.59" dur="1.98">It did like a billion damage to your life.</text><text start="150.57" dur="2.28">I mean the whole, like, no
noise when you jump thing,</text><text start="152.85" dur="0.833">was really great.</text><text start="153.683" dur="1.777">This just silent assassin
just comes out of the trees,</text><text start="155.46" dur="2.444">goes HI-YA, and then he stuns
you and then you&amp;#39;re dead.</text><text start="159.96" dur="2.52">Yeah, I mean, no comment on that.</text><text start="162.48" dur="2.22">Like, that was probably the
most easiest hero to play</text><text start="164.7" dur="0.833">when it came out.</text><text start="165.533" dur="2.077">Get hit four times and
I&amp;#39;m dead, like, okay.</text><text start="167.61" dur="2.04">Insane mobility, you cannot man fight.</text><text start="169.65" dur="1.56">He just kills everything.</text><text start="171.21" dur="0.84">There was still this time,</text><text start="172.05" dur="1.92">where like Bash worked
on his Ultimate.</text><text start="173.97" dur="2.46">It&amp;#39;s like, this is unplayable.</text><text start="176.43" dur="1.23">Unplayable.</text><text start="177.66" dur="2.61">That sounds like another
member of our elite cadre.</text><text start="180.27" dur="2.19">Kaolin, the Earth Spirit,</text><text start="182.46" dur="2.49">not new by any stretch of the imagination.</text><text start="184.95" dur="4.68">This geological aberration
has been with us since 2013,</text><text start="189.63" dur="2.85">but when he first rolled
into the game, well,</text><text start="192.48" dur="1.623">personally I think it was fine.</text><text start="196.29" dur="2.67">And before them Earth Spirit
had similar vibes to that.</text><text start="198.96" dur="1.59">It&amp;#39;s like he saw you and you were dead.</text><text start="200.55" dur="2.43">He rolls on you, he kicks
you six miles backwards.</text><text start="202.98" dur="2.04">You&amp;#39;re in the tower, you&amp;#39;re
insta silenced, stunned.</text><text start="205.02" dur="4.08">He has some reverse geomagnetic
force staff thing going on.</text><text start="209.1" dur="1">That hero was something else.</text><text start="210.299" dur="1.501">I think the pull stun, so you do, like,</text><text start="211.8" dur="2.46">pull in to roll and to
kick into your tower,</text><text start="214.26" dur="2.02">you just play versus
like JerAx or w33haa</text><text start="216.29" dur="1.75">and they would just kill
you off cooldown mid.</text><text start="218.04" dur="1.257">You wouldn&amp;#39;t even know what&amp;#39;s happening.</text><text start="219.45" dur="3.861">Back then, every single one of this spells
was insanely strong.</text><text start="223.965" dur="3.085">His damage was also very high,
and could be played mid.</text><text start="227.05" dur="2.501">Earth Spirit specialists had a ticket
to easy MMR on ranked.</text><text start="229.98" dur="2.22">Earth Spirit, it took,
it required some finesse.</text><text start="232.2" dur="2.273">You know, you needed like
some JerAx or Cr1t- out there,</text><text start="234.473" dur="0.737">like you know.</text><text start="235.213" dur="2.357">Like, I know the hero was
pretty dumb when it came out.</text><text start="237.57" dur="4.83">But I also like measure ease
of like, you know, execution.</text><text start="243.676" dur="2.834">And if it was purely ease of execution,</text><text start="246.51" dur="2.493">you know... OOH OOH OOH, die.</text><text start="250.59" dur="1.62">Mixed feelings, certainly.</text><text start="252.21" dur="1.68">But what about our next hero?</text><text start="253.89" dur="2.58">Will they be afforded
the benefit of the doubt?</text><text start="256.47" dur="4.02">Can a group of three
pyrotechnically gifted maniacs</text><text start="260.49" dur="1.83">really be so bad?</text><text start="262.32" dur="2.94">Their names are Squee, Spleen and Spoon.</text><text start="265.26" dur="1.59">May he rest in peace?</text><text start="266.85" dur="2.913">So after all, how bad can it really be?</text><text start="274.59" dur="2.58">I think playing as old
Techies was like a nightmare.</text><text start="277.17" dur="4.74">Every time I decide to
play Dota like 3:00 AM,</text><text start="281.91" dur="2.43">someone in the enemy team
decide to pick Techies</text><text start="284.34" dur="1.8">and I really wanted to abandon.</text><text start="286.14" dur="1.41">A lot of Dota is about</text><text start="287.55" dur="2.16">inflicting some pain upon your opponents</text><text start="289.71" dur="2.31">and like sucking all the fun to yourself.</text><text start="292.02" dur="1.11">But I feel like Techies did that</text><text start="293.13" dur="1.98">to both your team and the enemy team.</text><text start="295.11" dur="2.46">There&amp;#39;s like 10 people and
only one person gets to have fun.</text><text start="297.57" dur="1.08">Being able to insta kill someone</text><text start="298.65" dur="1.68">from across the map while dead</text><text start="300.33" dur="1.62">has no business being in Dota.</text><text start="301.95" dur="1.83">Now the game is gonna
get prolonged 20 minutes.</text><text start="303.78" dur="1.17">I wanted to go have lunch,</text><text start="304.95" dur="1.98">but my day has been hijacked by this guy</text><text start="306.93" dur="1.38">who sabotages everyone else&amp;#39;s fun</text><text start="308.31" dur="1.74">and siphons it into his own.</text><text start="310.05" dur="2.07">That&amp;#39;s the best change in Dota, honestly.</text><text start="312.12" dur="1.71">That stupid hero got changed.</text><text start="313.83" dur="1.65">You don&amp;#39;t wanna be one of those guys</text><text start="315.48" dur="1.14">that plays Techies, you know?</text><text start="316.62" dur="2.61">And every idiot that played that hero,</text><text start="319.23" dur="2.163">that liked the old Techies, you know.</text><text start="322.38" dur="1.487">Like, sorry, sorry to you, but...</text><text start="323.867" dur="2.563">I have nothing good to say about
Techies, Slacks, I&amp;#39;m sorry.</text><text start="326.43" dur="2.07">Super glad the hero&amp;#39;s
gone, may he never return.</text><text start="328.5" dur="1.14">I&amp;#39;m sorry, Slacks, I know that hurts you</text><text start="329.64" dur="1.08">and cuts you deeply.</text><text start="330.72" dur="2.275">Find a new game, find a new game.</text><text start="337.62" dur="1.2">Oh dear.</text><text start="338.82" dur="2.61">Damning indictments all around there.</text><text start="341.43" dur="1.71">But ask yourselves this,</text><text start="343.14" dur="2.43">if every hero was perfectly balanced,</text><text start="345.57" dur="2.881">would the game be better for it, hmm?</text><text start="348.451" dur="1.199">You do think that?</text><text start="349.65" dur="1.44">Yeah, well.</text><text start="351.09" dur="1.56">As I always like to say</text><text start="352.65" dur="2.94">a journey bereft of drama,
is a journey forgotten.</text><text start="355.59" dur="2.22">But one stuffed with action, intrigue,</text><text start="357.81" dur="2.82">even disaster, will
live long in the memory.</text><text start="360.63" dur="3.24">And isn&amp;#39;t that what Dota is all about?</text><text start="363.87" dur="2.271">I&amp;#39;ll leave you to ponder
that for yourselves.</text><text start="366.141" dur="0.833">Good night.</text></transcript>
