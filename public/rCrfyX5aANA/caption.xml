 </text><text start="20.08" dur="2.48">Eight healthy habits</text><text start="22.6" dur="5.2">in middle age may increase your life
by more than twenty years.</text><text start="27.8" dur="1.84">According to research,</text><text start="29.64" dur="3.8">you can lengthen your life
by doing regular exercise,</text><text start="33.44" dur="5.12">having a healthy diet,
positive social relationships</text><text start="38.56" dur="5.2">and a regular sleep routine,
and avoiding stress,</text><text start="43.76" dur="5.16">smoking, opioid drugs
and too much alcohol.</text><text start="48.92" dur="3.24">The study was carried out
over eight years and</text><text start="52.16" dur="4.12">more than 700,000
Americans took part in it.</text><text start="56.28" dur="1.52">You&amp;#39;ve been looking
at the headlines, Beth.</text><text start="57.8" dur="2.6">What&amp;#39;s the vocabulary?
We have:</text><text start="60.4" dur="6.04">kicking habits, longevity and adopting.
This is News Review from</text><text start="66.44" dur="2.8">BBC Learning English.</text><text start="77.24" dur="2.6">Let&amp;#39;s have a look at
our first headline.</text><text start="79.84" dur="3.24">This is from The Independent.
 </text><text start="83.08" dur="4.48">Kicking these eight habits could help
you live 20 years longer,</text><text start="87.56" dur="3.12">scientists say.
So, kicking these habits</text><text start="90.68" dur="4.68">can help you live longer. A habit
is something that you do regularly.</text><text start="95.36" dur="2.56">Sometimes a good thing, like exercise.</text><text start="97.92" dur="5.16">Sometimes a bad thing, like smoking.
But &amp;#39;kick&amp;#39;? You kick a football.</text><text start="103.08" dur="3.68">You can kick something away,
but kick a habit?</text><text start="106.76" dur="3.48">Well, think of the
literal action of kick.</text><text start="110.24" dur="1.68">If you kick a football,</text><text start="111.92" dur="4.72">then you move it out of your way,
possibly quite quickly and violently.</text><text start="116.64" dur="5.72">So, if you kick a bad habit, like
smoking or drinking too much alcohol,</text><text start="122.36" dur="3.64">then your metaphorically
forcing it away from you.</text><text start="126" dur="1.8">You&amp;#39;re stopping the habit.</text><text start="127.8" dur="4.84">Yeah. And we use &amp;#39;kick&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;habit&amp;#39;
together very regularly,</text><text start="132.64" dur="4.32">especially to talk about something
that you really want to stop doing.</text><text start="136.96" dur="2">Beth, have you kicked a habit
or is there one</text><text start="138.96" dur="1.24">you really want to kick?</text><text start="140.2" dur="3.76">Well, I&amp;#39;m trying to stop eating
as much chocolate,</text><text start="143.96" dur="2.28">but I haven&amp;#39;t quite
kicked the habit yet.</text><text start="146.24" dur="2.4">What about you?
I really want to kick the habit</text><text start="148.64" dur="3.84">of checking my phone
all the time. I do it so often.</text><text start="152.48" dur="6.32">And it&amp;#39;s a really bad thing. I want to kick
that habit. Let&amp;#39;s look at that again.</text><text start="166.12" dur="2.04">Let&amp;#39;s have our
next headline.</text><text start="168.16" dur="2.36">This is from
WorldHealth.net.</text><text start="170.52" dur="6.24"> 
These habits may help
to extend your longevity by decades.</text><text start="176.76" dur="5.52">So, this headline says that these
habits will extend your longevity.</text><text start="182.28" dur="2.84">&amp;#39;Longevity&amp;#39; is the word
that we&amp;#39;re looking at.</text><text start="185.12" dur="3">I can see it&amp;#39;s got &amp;#39;long&amp;#39;
in it. Is there a connection?</text><text start="188.12" dur="6.68">There is. &amp;#39;longevity&amp;#39; is a noun
and it means living for a long time.</text><text start="194.8" dur="5">So, this headline is saying that having
these habits will make you live longer.</text><text start="199.8" dur="3.32">But there is another meaning
to longevity, isn&amp;#39;t there?</text><text start="203.12" dur="3.4">Yes, if something is popular
or useful for a long time</text><text start="206.52" dur="3.64">we can say that
it has longevity.</text><text start="210.16" dur="2.28">Now, for example,
flexible working</text><text start="212.44" dur="3.76">could be important
for longevity in a job,</text><text start="216.2" dur="3.12">meaning that people will want
to stay in their job longer</text><text start="219.32" dur="2.44">if it&amp;#39;s flexible.
And take note –</text><text start="221.76" dur="2.12">this word is quite formal,</text><text start="223.88" dur="3.68">so it is usually seen more
in writing than speaking.</text><text start="227.56" dur="2.4">I wouldn&amp;#39;t say</text><text start="229.96" dur="4.12">&amp;#39;Did you know that doing
exercise helps your longevity?&amp;#39;</text><text start="234.08" dur="2.96">I would say &amp;#39;it helps
you live longer&amp;#39;.</text><text start="237.04" dur="2.68">Yes. Now take note about
the pronunciation of this word –</text><text start="239.72" dur="1.88">it&amp;#39;s a little bit strange.</text><text start="241.6" dur="5.44">It&amp;#39;s longevity, so we have the /ŋ/
at the end of &amp;#39;long&amp;#39; as normal,</text><text start="247.04" dur="4.84">but then there&amp;#39;s this /dʒ/
sound as well – longevity.</text><text start="251.88" dur="2.12">Let&amp;#39;s look at that again.</text><text start="261.08" dur="1.84">Let&amp;#39;s have our
next headline.</text><text start="262.92" dur="4.76">This is from Perth Now.
Adopting eight simple</text><text start="267.68" dur="5.04">healthy habits could help
increase your lifespan by decades,</text><text start="272.72" dur="1.56">a survey finds.</text><text start="274.28" dur="4.04">So, this headline is saying
you can achieve &amp;#39;longevity&amp;#39;,</text><text start="278.32" dur="3.8">that&amp;#39;s the word that we just looked
at, by adopting these habits.</text><text start="282.12" dur="1.32">&amp;#39;Adopting&amp;#39; is the word</text><text start="283.44" dur="2.56">we&amp;#39;re looking at now.
Now, Beth,</text><text start="286" dur="3.68">there was a kitten living in
our street and it didn&amp;#39;t have a home,</text><text start="289.68" dur="2">so we brought it
into our home to live.</text><text start="291.68" dur="1.44">We adopted it.</text><text start="293.12" dur="2.48">Well, that&amp;#39;s very
cute. &amp;#39;adopt&amp;#39;</text><text start="295.6" dur="4.8">can be when you take responsibility
for something, like your kitten.</text><text start="300.4" dur="1.16">If it&amp;#39;s a child, then</text><text start="301.56" dur="4.12">that is a legal process –
you adopt a child.</text><text start="305.68" dur="2">Now, Neil, when you
adopted your kitten</text><text start="307.68" dur="2">it became yours.</text><text start="309.68" dur="5.08">And that idea is the same as in the
headline with &amp;#39;adopt&amp;#39;. It means taken</text><text start="314.76" dur="1.32">and now belongs to you.</text><text start="316.08" dur="4.4">Yes. So the headline is saying
that you can take these healthy habits</text><text start="320.48" dur="2.76">and apply them to yourself.</text><text start="323.24" dur="5.36">Now, it&amp;#39;s not just these habits that
you can adopt, or kittens, or children.</text><text start="328.6" dur="3.24">You can also adopt a new approach,</text><text start="331.84" dur="4.2">for example. Or a person might
adopt a new attitude.</text><text start="336.04" dur="5.76">That&amp;#39;s right. I watched a documentary
about being vegetarian.</text><text start="341.8" dur="4">Could I say that I have
adopted a new diet?</text><text start="345.8" dur="2.76">You could – it does
sound a little bit formal.</text><text start="348.56" dur="1.16">I understand what you mean,</text><text start="349.72" dur="5.32">but probably you&amp;#39;d just say I&amp;#39;ve changed
my diet, or I&amp;#39;ve changed the way I eat.</text><text start="355.04" dur="2.04">Let&amp;#39;s look at that again.</text><text start="362.56" dur="4.08">We&amp;#39;ve had: kicking habits –
stopping bad habits.</text><text start="366.64" dur="4.28">longevity – living or
lasting a long time,</text><text start="370.92" dur="2.32">and adopting –
taking as your own.</text><text start="373.24" dur="2.44">Now, if you&amp;#39;re interested in longevity</text><text start="375.68" dur="1.88">We recently asked</text><text start="377.56" dur="3.069">could humans live to 140 years old?  </text><text start="380.629" dur="1.746">Click here to watch that video</text><text start="382.375" dur="5.376">And don&amp;#39;t forget to click here to subscribe to our channel so you never miss another video.</text><text start="387.751" dur="1.822">Thanks for joining us.
