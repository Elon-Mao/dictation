from BBC Learning English.  I’m Neil.</text><text start="11.6" dur="1.04">And I’m Beth
 </text><text start="12.68" dur="2.84">There are many ways of saying sorry in English,</text><text start="15.52" dur="2.16">and they all have
a slightly different meaning.</text><text start="17.72" dur="2.4">If you tell me you’re ill,
and I say,</text><text start="20.12" dur="4.08">“Oh, I&amp;#39;m sorry”, that means: I sympathise,
and I hope you get better soon.</text><text start="24.32" dur="2.44">If you step on my toes by mistake,</text><text start="26.76" dur="1.16">and say,“I’m so sorry”,</text><text start="27.92" dur="4.56">you mean: oops that was my fault
and I didn&amp;#39;t mean to do it.</text><text start="32.48" dur="3.08">And if you don’t really feel sorry,
you might be sarcastic,</text><text start="35.56" dur="4.2">“Oh,  I’m soooo sorry!”
meaning exactly the opposite –</text><text start="39.8" dur="2.16">that you’re not sorry at all.</text><text start="41.96" dur="4.12">Saying sorry for something you’ve done
in English can be quite confusing,</text><text start="46.08" dur="4.92">and to make things worse, the British
are world champions at apologising.</text><text start="51.04" dur="3.8">In this programme
we&amp;#39;ll discuss ways of saying sorry,</text><text start="54.84" dur="3.68">and as usual we&amp;#39;ll be learning
some useful new vocabulary as well.</text><text start="58.56" dur="0.56">Sorry!</text><text start="59.16" dur="3.44">but I&amp;#39;m going to have to stop you
there, Beth, because first I have</text><text start="62.6" dur="4.76">a question to ask. We know that the
British love to say sorry. In fact</text><text start="67.36" dur="4.84">a recent survey found that some Brits
apologise up to twenty times a day.</text><text start="72.24" dur="2.32">So, according to the same survey,
 </text><text start="74.6" dur="4.64">how many times per day
does the average Brit say sorry?</text><text start="79.24" dur="2.12">Is it: a) four times per day.</text><text start="81.36" dur="5.12">b) six times per day or,
c) eight times per day.</text><text start="86.48" dur="3.12">I&amp;#39;m going to guess
it’s six times a day.</text><text start="89.64" dur="3.28">OK, Beth, I’ll reveal the answer
later in the programme.</text><text start="92.92" dur="4.56">Since the British are famous for apologising
it’s no surprise that</text><text start="97.48" dur="4.4"> 
Louise Mullany started researching
the language of apologising in Britain,</text><text start="101.88" dur="2.2">at the University of Nottingham.</text><text start="104.08" dur="2.88">Now a professor of sociolinguistics,</text><text start="106.96" dur="3.72"> 
Louise spoke with BBC Radio
Four programme, Word of Mouth:</text><text start="110.72" dur="4.6">And I was really interested
in looking at how people apologise,</text><text start="115.32" dur="3.24">particularly public figures so I did
a lot of research in the workplace</text><text start="118.56" dur="1.76">and looking at the media,</text><text start="120.32" dur="2.2">and looking
at politicians in particular,</text><text start="122.52" dur="3">and one of the things that
really interested me at the time was</text><text start="125.52" dur="3.4">a lot of writers were talking about
us entering an age of an apology,</text><text start="128.92" dur="3.48">and there&amp;#39;s a real sense that public
figures in particular are called</text><text start="132.4" dur="2.96">upon to apologise
for multiple different things,</text><text start="135.36" dur="3.68">and if they don&amp;#39;t apologise then
that&amp;#39;s a big faux pas.</text><text start="139.04" dur="3.52">Saying sorry is especially important
in politics,</text><text start="142.56" dur="4.76">and Professor Mullany studied the
apologies of public figures – famous people,</text><text start="147.32" dur="1.64">including politicians,</text><text start="148.96" dur="5.56">who are often discussed in newspapers
and seen on radio and television.</text><text start="154.52" dur="4.12">When politicians make mistakes
they are expected to apologise,</text><text start="158.68" dur="4.2">and failing to say sorry
is a faux pas – a remark made</text><text start="162.88" dur="4.32">in a social situation
that causes embarrassment or offence.</text><text start="167.24" dur="3.84">Most politicians hate apologizing
and with good reason.</text><text start="171.08" dur="2.52">Saying sorry
means taking responsibility,</text><text start="173.6" dur="5.04">and the apology needs to be sincere.
A good example of this is the apology</text><text start="178.64" dur="4.6">Boris Johnson made to the House of
Commons during the Partygate scandal</text><text start="183.24" dur="4.2">in the UK when he broke
COVID lockdown rules and had to pay</text><text start="187.44" dur="4.68">a fine -  that&amp;#39;s a sum of money paid as
a punishment for breaking the rules.</text><text start="192.12" dur="6">Here, Professor Louise Mullany, analyses the
apology for BBC Radio Four programme,</text><text start="198.12" dur="0.96">Word of Mouth:</text><text start="199.08" dur="2.08">It&amp;#39;s very unusual
in a political apology</text><text start="201.16" dur="2.8">because he comes out and says,
‘I am responsible’,</text><text start="203.96" dur="3.76">but there is the caveat
that he wasn&amp;#39;t certain</text><text start="207.72" dur="1.44">that he was breaking the rules,</text><text start="209.16" dur="4.68">he didn&amp;#39;t realise which he continues
to say in his apology that came out</text><text start="213.84" dur="0.92">after the fine,</text><text start="214.76" dur="1.32">so he repeats the apology,</text><text start="216.08" dur="3.6">and he caveats it
around other political events and</text><text start="219.68" dur="5.4">he uses humility when he was in the
House the day after he paid his fine,</text><text start="225.12" dur="1.6">and was very quick to say,
‘I&amp;#39;ve paid the fine,</text><text start="226.76" dur="1.6">I’ve given the reparation,</text><text start="228.36" dur="3.96">I’ve paid the money, let&amp;#39;s draw
a line under the whole business now’.</text><text start="232.32" dur="4.32">Boris Johnson claimed he didn’t know
he was breaking the rules.</text><text start="236.64" dur="5.48">His apology contained a caveat –
a warning that what he said was limited,</text><text start="242.16" dur="1.72">or not completely true.</text><text start="243.88" dur="2.96">Eventually,
Boris Johnson did apologise,</text><text start="246.84" dur="4.28">but many people didn’t trust him
and he couldn’t draw a line</text><text start="251.12" dur="1.8">under the Partygate scandal.</text><text start="252.92" dur="4.84">If you draw a line under something, you try
to move on from a bad situation</text><text start="257.76" dur="1.36">and make a fresh start.</text><text start="259.12" dur="3.6">Apologising is hard work
– the apology must be sincere,</text><text start="262.72" dur="3.68">and often the person does something
to show they mean it.</text><text start="266.4" dur="4.72">which reminds me that it’s time to
reveal the answer to my question, Beth.</text><text start="271.12" dur="4.48">Yes.  You asked me how many times
a day the average Brit says sorry,</text><text start="275.6" dur="3">and I guessed it was six.
Was I right?</text><text start="278.6" dur="2.16">Well, I’m very sorry,
but that was…</text><text start="280.76" dur="1.32">the wrong answer.</text><text start="282.08" dur="3.32">The average Brit says
sorry around eight times a day,</text><text start="285.4" dur="3.84">making it probably the most over-used
word in the English language.</text><text start="289.24" dur="1.32">Sorry about that!</text><text start="290.56" dur="3.44">Right, let&amp;#39;s recap the vocabulary
we&amp;#39;ve learned from this programme</text><text start="294.04" dur="1.2">about saying sorry,</text><text start="295.24" dur="5.32">starting with sarcastic, doing or saying
the opposite of what you really mean,</text><text start="300.56" dur="3.04">for example
saying ‘I’m reeeally sorry!’,</text><text start="303.6" dur="1.04">when you aren’t.</text><text start="304.64" dur="2.16">A public figure is a famous person</text><text start="306.8" dur="4.08">whose life and behaviour is often
discussed in the media and in public.</text><text start="310.88" dur="3.92">A faux pas is a socially
embarrassing remark or action.</text><text start="314.8" dur="3.08">A fine is a sum of money paid
as a punishment</text><text start="317.88" dur="3.16">for doing something illegal
or breaking a rule.</text><text start="321.04" dur="3.92">If you say something with a caveat,
it contains a warning that what you</text><text start="324.96" dur="4.36"> 
have said may not be completely true
or is limited in some way.</text><text start="329.32" dur="3.96">And finally, if you draw a line under
something you consider it finished</text><text start="333.28" dur="2.48">in order to move on
and make a fresh start.</text><text start="335.76" dur="4.08">I’m sorry to say that, once again,
our six minutes are up and</text><text start="339.84" dur="3.4">it’s time to draw a line under
this programme! Goodbye for now! Bye!</text><text start="343.24" dur="1.04">Sorry, everyone.</text><text start="344.28" dur="1.4">We haven&amp;#39;t finished yet.</text><text start="345.68" dur="3.64">Oh, yeah. Sorry. We want to tell you
about some of our other podcasts,</text><text start="349.32" dur="1.72">Actually, we
shouldn&amp;#39;t have to apologise</text><text start="351.04" dur="2.08">because the other podcasts are
brilliant.</text><text start="353.12" dur="3.48">True, you can learn vocabulary
