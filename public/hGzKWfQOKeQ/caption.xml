<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="8.94" dur="4.8">Hello. This is 6 Minute English from 
BBC Learning English. I’m Beth.
 </text><text start="13.74" dur="2.58">And I’m Neil.
Nowadays we are so  </text><text start="16.32" dur="6.72">used to getting food whenever we want that we’ve 
almost forgotten how we managed in the past. But  </text><text start="23.04" dur="6.54">for thousands of years before supermarkets, humans 
found food through foraging – moving from place to  </text><text start="29.58" dur="5.22">place looking for wild food to eat.
Since the Covid pandemic, foraging for  </text><text start="34.8" dur="6">wild food has become popular again. Why go 
to the shops when you can walk into nearby  </text><text start="40.8" dur="5.4">countryside and parks to collect edible 
plants, mushrooms, and fruit for free?
 </text><text start="46.2" dur="6">Of course, you can’t eat everything you find 
growing outside - some poisonous plants can  </text><text start="52.2" dur="5.4">make you very ill. But there’s something exciting 
about setting off on a culinary treasure hunt  </text><text start="57.6" dur="4.62">to find new edible plants for dinner.
In this programme, we’ll be hearing about  </text><text start="62.22" dur="6.18">a new foraging project taking place across 
the UK, and, as usual, we&amp;#39;ll be learning  </text><text start="68.4" dur="4.14">some useful new vocabulary as well.
But first I have a question for you,  </text><text start="72.54" dur="7.8">Neil. 2019 was a good year for the group, Wild 
Food UK, with the launch of their foraging pocket  </text><text start="80.34" dur="5.94">guide, a handbook aimed at helping foragers 
find and identify safe wild food to eat.  </text><text start="86.82" dur="7.08">So according to the group’s website, what is 
the most popular food foraged in the UK? Is it:  </text><text start="93.9" dur="8.82">a) seaweed? b) berries? or c) mushrooms?
There’s so much coastline in Britain,  </text><text start="102.72" dur="5.58">I reckon it must be a) seaweed.
OK. I&amp;#39;ll reveal the answer later in the programme.  </text><text start="109.2" dur="4.5">Monica Wilde, known as Mo, is the 
author of The Wilderness Cure,  </text><text start="113.7" dur="7.98">a book charting her year of eating only wild 
food. Mo is one of a group of 26 experienced  </text><text start="121.68" dur="6.48">foragers taking part in the ‘Wild Biome Project’, 
a three-month experiment into the health benefits  </text><text start="128.16" dur="7.26">of introducing wild food into your diet.
Microbiome are tiny organisms including bacteria  </text><text start="135.42" dur="5.88">and fungi which live in the human digestive 
system, help break down food, and strengthen  </text><text start="141.3" dur="6.84">immune defence. The idea is that natural 
unprocessed foods found in the wild support our  </text><text start="148.14" dur="6.18">microbiome, leading to a range of health benefits 
from weight loss to increased energy levels. The  </text><text start="154.32" dur="6.3">foragers’ microbiome is measured and monitored 
before, during and after the experiment. Here’s  </text><text start="160.62" dur="5.7">Mo Wilde chatting with one of the foragers, Rob 
Gould, for BBC Radio 4’s, The Food Programme.
 </text><text start="167.28" dur="5.16">Even if you don&amp;#39;t buy into the whole idea of 
fully encompassing a wild diet - because for  </text><text start="172.44" dur="5.58">most people it&amp;#39;s fairly much unattainable 
- but for people just incorporating a small  </text><text start="178.02" dur="4.86">amount of wild food into their diet, you’re 
increasing massively the amount of nutrients,  </text><text start="182.88" dur="2.4">the micronutrients and the 
vitamins that you&amp;#39;re getting,  </text><text start="185.28" dur="5.04">a lot of which aren&amp;#39;t even available 
regularly in your commonly bought foods.
 </text><text start="190.32" dur="4.56">Sometimes people say, ‘Oh well, you know, if 
everybody foraged, they wouldn&amp;#39;t be enough’, but  </text><text start="194.88" dur="5.16">I&amp;#39;ve never noticed a shortage of nettles, and if 
nettles didn&amp;#39;t grow in this country, we&amp;#39;d probably  </text><text start="200.04" dur="5.88">be flying them in as a superfood because there&amp;#39;s 
so nutritious, and above all they’re free.
 </text><text start="207.3" dur="5.16">With the high levels of nutrients and 
vitamins found in wild plants like nettles,  </text><text start="212.46" dur="7.08">Rob has bought into the idea of foraging. If you 
buy into an idea, you completely believe in it.
 </text><text start="219.54" dur="5.88">Did you say stinging nettles - the wild plants 
growing everywhere which have leaves covered  </text><text start="225.42" dur="5.94">in hairs that sting when you touch them?
Yes, it turns out that nettles are packed  </text><text start="231.36" dur="4.98">full of nutrients and vitamins which 
are great for human health. In fact,  </text><text start="236.34" dur="6.42">they’re even considered a superfood - food 
that contains many vitamins and other nutrients  </text><text start="242.76" dur="4.98">known to be very good for human health.
The Wild Biome Project hasn’t finished yet,  </text><text start="247.74" dur="5.46">but it already seems that the foragers are 
feeling happier as well as healthier. They  </text><text start="253.2" dur="4.38">all report greater appreciation for 
the smell and taste of their food,  </text><text start="257.58" dur="5.34">and say foraging has given them increased 
self-worth, a natural treatment for depression  </text><text start="262.92" dur="6.06">and anxiety. Here’s one forager describing her 
feelings to BBC Radio 4’s, The Food Programme.
 </text><text start="270.24" dur="6.72">I found the first week I felt really quite flat, 
quite limited carbs coming in from chestnut flour  </text><text start="276.96" dur="5.1">primarily. Feeling loads better now… feeling 
loads better in the last few days, and I&amp;#39;m really  </text><text start="282.06" dur="3.3">enjoying the project… having a great time, 
in fact. I don&amp;#39;t really want it to stop.
 </text><text start="286.32" dur="4.92">At the start of the experiment this 
forager felt flat – low in energy,  </text><text start="291.24" dur="7.44">emotion or excitement, but after some weeks of 
wild food, fresh air and appreciation of nature,  </text><text start="298.68" dur="6.3">she doesn’t want the project to stop.
Well, I’m convinced! So, what’s first on my  </text><text start="304.98" dur="5.1">wild food shopping list? I think it’s time you 
revealed the answer to your question, Beth.
 </text><text start="310.08" dur="7.74">Right, I asked what was the most popular foraged 
food in the UK, and you guessed it was seaweed,  </text><text start="317.82" dur="6.12">which was the wrong answer. Mushrooms 
are the most popular foraged food. OK,  </text><text start="323.94" dur="5.4">let&amp;#39;s recap the vocabulary we&amp;#39;ve learned 
from this programme about foraging - looking  </text><text start="329.34" dur="4.86">for wild edible plants to eat.
Microbiome are tiny bacteria and  </text><text start="334.2" dur="4.92">organisms in the human gut which help 
digest food and strengthen immunity.
 </text><text start="339.12" dur="4.14">If you buy into an idea, you 
completely believe in it.
 </text><text start="343.26" dur="4.14">Nettles are common nutritious 
edible plants with leaves covered  </text><text start="347.4" dur="4.86">in hairs that sting when touched.
A superfood describes a food containing  </text><text start="352.26" dur="5.88">many vitamins and other healthy nutrients.
And finally, the adjective flat means lacking  </text><text start="358.14" dur="6.18">energy, emotion or excitement – and probably 
means you should go outside and get foraging! Once  </text><text start="364.32" dur="2.76">again, our 6 minutes are up. Goodbye for now!
Bye!</text></transcript>
